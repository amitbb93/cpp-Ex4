## BullPgia project:
In this project we have created an algorithm that guess an answer within 100 turns by getting "Bull & Pgia" feedback as the original game "Bulls & Cows".
When you start a new game the "Chooser" chooses a number (with no specific length, can start with any digit and may be repeat more than one time). The main function "play" connects between the "Chooser" & "Gusser" & "calculate" and return the number of attempts it took the "Gusser" to find out the right secret number, if it took more the limit turns the function returns the limit plus 1 and it means the game is over with no successess.
